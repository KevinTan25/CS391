            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>MapReduce | <em>Go, Git</em></h3>
            <em><strong>February 2024 – March 2024</strong></em>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented a MapReduce framework to efficiently process and analyze large datasets, optimizing data workflows.</li>
                <li>Developed custom map and reduce functions to handle specific data processing tasks, significantly reducing computational time.</li>
                <li>Utilized parallel computing techniques to scale data processing operations, enhancing overall system performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h3>Raft | <em>Go, Git</em></h3>
            <em><strong>March 2024 – May 2024</strong></em>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented the Raft consensus algorithm as a replicated state machine protocol to achieve fault-tolerant distributed systems.</li>
                <li>Developed a robust log synchronization mechanism to ensure all replica servers maintain consistent state, even during server failures or network issues.</li>
                <li>Designed the Raft module using Go, incorporating RPC communication between instances to manage log entries and maintain replicated logs.</li>
                <li>Employed concurrency techniques and resource locking strategies to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the Raft implementation.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Spotify Concert Recommendation | <em>Python, Git, APIs, Javascript, HTML, CSS</em></h3>
            <em><strong>January 2024 – May 2024</strong></em>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a full-stack service-oriented website that leverages Spotify’s API to analyze users’ listening history and recommend live concerts/events based on their top artists.</li>
                <li>Integrated Ticketmaster’s API to provide real-time event listings and concert details, enhancing user engagement with personalized recommendations.</li>
                <li>Designed and implemented both front-end and back-end components to create a seamless user experience, utilizing modern web development frameworks.</li>
            </ul>
        </main>
